The main symptoms of coronavirus are:

A high temperature: this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)

A new, continuous cough: this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)

A loss or change to your sense of smell or taste: this means you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal
